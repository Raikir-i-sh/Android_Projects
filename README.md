# Android_Projects
List of source codes of some android apps made using Android Studio. Some projects were simply made by following tutorials from Udacity's Android Basics Course, while LibrarySystem , NoteTaking apps were made by me.   
Library System is an app built to be used by Librarian and students. Students take a book from library after showing it librarian. Librarian scans students ID using QR code in his/her Id card. After the new screen opens up, books are scanned whose Id's are then stored for that specific student. When Book is being returned , similar check is done again and the returned book is taken out of "List of books taken" by that student. SqlLite is the in-built database system in Android which is used to storing data.
